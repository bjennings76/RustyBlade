"After 30 years, an old adventurer comes out of retirement to gain one last level, the arduous level 99. As the dust falls off the rusty blade thoughts of regret and awakened wonderment of what is to come begin to seep in..."

## Idea
Old adventurer doesn't quite make it to level 99, but his sword lives on. You inherit the sword and must take care of it to honor your parent. It is now your companion. Will you be able to care for it through your own battles and adventures?
